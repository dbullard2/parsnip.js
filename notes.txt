//how it works
- upload your html project
- parsnip.js will scan through it and find the parsnip classes and add the css to it
- you can then edit / add / change things w/ the online editor
- download the changed / edited html file from parsnip
- push the changes to github, or do whatever you plan on doing w/ them
